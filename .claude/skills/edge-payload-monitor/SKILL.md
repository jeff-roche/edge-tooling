# Edge Payload Monitor Skill

You are helping a developer monitor OpenShift nightly payload health for edge topologies (SNO, TNA, TNF). This skill orchestrates the `payload-monitor` Python tool and existing marketplace CI skills to generate an interactive HTML dashboard report with AI-powered root cause analysis for blocking job failures.

## Existing Skills Reference

This skill composes with the following installed marketplace CI skills from the [ai-helpers](https://github.com/openshift-eng/ai-helpers) repository. These are used automatically for blocking job analysis:

### Data Fetching Skills
| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `ci:fetch-payloads` | Fetch recent release payloads from the release controller — use as a cross-check or when the Python tool's data needs supplementation |
| `ci:fetch-releases` | Fetch available OpenShift releases from Sippy — use to auto-discover active streams |
| `ci:fetch-test-report` | Fetch test report from Sippy with pass rates, test ID, and Jira component — use for per-test regression detail |
| `ci:fetch-job-run-summary` | Fetch a Prow job run summary with all failed tests grouped by SIG — use to understand failure scope |
| `ci:fetch-prowjob-json` | Fetch key data from a Prow job's prowjob.json artifact — use for job metadata |
| `ci:fetch-new-prs-in-payload` | Fetch PRs new in a payload compared to previous — use to identify suspect PRs causing regressions |
| `ci:fetch-regression-details` | Fetch detailed Component Readiness regression info from Sippy — use for Sippy regressions |
| `ci:fetch-related-triages` | Fetch existing triages and untriaged regressions related to a given regression — use to avoid duplicate work |
| `ci:fetch-jira-issue` | Fetch JIRA issue details including status, assignee, comments, and progress classification — use for enriched bug context |
| `ci:fetch-test-runs` | Fetch test runs from Sippy including outputs for AI similarity analysis — use to compare failure patterns |

### Deep Analysis Skills
| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `ci:analyze-payload` | Full payload analysis with historical lookback and HTML report — use for rejected/failing payloads with edge blockers |
| `ci:prow-job-analyze-test-failure` | Analyze failed tests by inspecting test code, downloading artifacts, and optionally integrating must-gather — use for any failing edge test |
| `ci:prow-job-analyze-install-failure` | Analyze OpenShift install failures from installer logs, log bundles, and sosreports — use when edge jobs fail at install stage |
| `ci:prow-job-analyze-metal-install-failure` | Analyze bare metal install failures using dev-scripts artifacts — use for metal/baremetal SNO or TNF jobs with "metal" in name |
| `ci:prow-job-analyze-resource` | Analyze K8s resource lifecycle in Prow job artifacts (audit logs, pod logs) — use when failure involves resource state issues |
| `ci:prow-job-artifact-search` | Search, list, and fetch artifacts from Prow job runs in GCS — use when you need to find specific artifacts |
| `ci:prow-job-extract-must-gather` | Extract and decompress must-gather archives — use when cluster diagnostics are needed |
| `ci:analyze-regression` | Analyze Component Readiness regression details and suggest next steps — use for Sippy-detected regressions |
| `ci:check-if-jira-regression-is-ongoing` | Check if a JIRA regression bug is still ongoing or resolved — use to validate whether known bugs still apply |

### Action Skills
| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `ci:set-release-blocker` | Set Release Blocker field on a JIRA issue — use when an edge failure is blocking payload acceptance |
| `ci:triage-regression` | Create or update a Component Readiness triage record — use when a Sippy regression needs to be triaged |
| `ci:revert-pr` | Revert a merged PR breaking CI/payloads — use when a specific PR is identified as the root cause |
| `ci:trigger-payload-job` | Trigger payload testing on a PR — use to verify a fix resolves the payload failure |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine options:

- **`--versions X,Y,Z`**: Override which OCP versions to monitor (e.g., `--versions 4.18,4.19`)
- **`--skip-prow`**: Skip Prow artifact fetching (faster, less detail)
- **`--skip-sippy`**: Skip Sippy regression check
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty: use defaults (all configured versions)

### Step 2: Run the Python Tool

Run the payload monitor Python tool to collect data and generate the base report:

```bash
cd payload-monitor && python -m payload_monitor --output reports/report-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).html [OPTIONS]
```

Pass through any relevant flags (`--versions`, `--skip-prow`, `--skip-sippy`).

**Important:** If a report with the same filename already exists, the tool automatically appends a timestamp (e.g., `report-2026-03-25-143027.html`). Capture the actual output path from the tool's log line:
- `Report: /path/to/report-{name}.html`

Use this actual path (not the hardcoded date-based name) in all subsequent steps.

The tool outputs:
- An HTML report (self-contained interactive dashboard)
- A blocking summary file (`.blocking.json`) — a small file listing only failing blocking edge jobs with their prow URLs, topology, version, and payload tag

### Step 3: Read Blocking Summary and Analyze Failures

Read the small `.blocking.json` file matching the actual report path from Step 2 (**not** the full JSON — this saves tokens). It contains only the failing blocking edge jobs:

```json
[
  {
    "job_name": "periodic-ci-...-sno-...",
    "prow_url": "https://prow.ci.openshift.org/view/gs/.../123",
    "topology": "SNO",
    "version": "4.19",
    "payload_tag": "4.19.0-0.nightly-2026-03-25-085944"
  }
]
```

If the file does not exist or is empty, skip to Step 5 (no blocking failures to analyze).

**For informing job failures:** Do NOT run deep analysis. The HTML report already includes a suggestion to use Claude directly with `/ci:prow-job-analyze-test-failure <prow-url>`.

#### Multi-Agent Orchestration (2+ blocking failures)

When there are **2 or more** blocking failures, use the Agent tool to analyze them **in parallel** — one subagent per blocking job. This significantly reduces wall-clock time.

For each blocking job, spawn a subagent with this prompt:

```
Analyze this failing blocking edge job and return a JSON deep_analysis object.

Job: {job_name}
Prow URL: {prow_url}
Topology: {topology}
Version: {version}
Payload: {payload_tag}

Steps:
1. Use `ci:fetch-job-run-summary` with the Prow URL to get all failed tests grouped by SIG
2. Use `ci:fetch-prowjob-json` with the Prow URL to get job metadata

Then based on failure type:
- If install failure (error contains "install should succeed", "bootstrap", or failed in pre/setup phase):
  Use `ci:prow-job-analyze-install-failure` (or `ci:prow-job-analyze-metal-install-failure` if job name contains "metal")
- If test failure (job passed install but failed during test phase):
  Use `ci:prow-job-analyze-test-failure`
- If resource/state failure (etcd issues, operator degraded, node not ready):
  Use `ci:prow-job-analyze-resource`

For payload context: use `ci:fetch-new-prs-in-payload` to identify suspect PRs.
For JIRA context: use `ci:fetch-jira-issue` for any linked bugs.

Return ONLY a JSON object with these fields:
{
  "prow_url": "{prow_url}",
  "root_cause": "One-sentence explanation",
  "failure_type": "Infrastructure flake | Test regression | Install failure | Platform issue",
  "impact": "How this affects payload acceptance and which topologies",
  "suspect_prs": ["https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"],
  "recommendation": "Specific next action"
}
```

Launch all subagents in parallel using multiple Agent tool calls in the same response. Collect their results and proceed to Step 4.

#### Single-Agent Analysis (1 blocking failure)

When there is exactly **1 blocking failure**, analyze it directly in the main agent (no subagent). The overhead of spawning a subagent provides no benefit for a single job — it adds latency from context setup without any parallelism gain.

Run the same analysis steps inline:

1. Use `ci:fetch-job-run-summary` to get all failed tests grouped by SIG
2. Use `ci:fetch-prowjob-json` to get job metadata

Then branch based on failure type:

- **Install failure** (error contains "install should succeed", "bootstrap", or job failed in pre/setup phase):
  Use `ci:prow-job-analyze-install-failure` for standard install failures.
  Use `ci:prow-job-analyze-metal-install-failure` if the job name contains "metal" (common for SNO/TNF baremetal jobs).
- **Test failure** (job passed install but failed during test phase):
  Use `ci:prow-job-analyze-test-failure` to inspect test code, download artifacts, and identify root cause.
- **Resource/state failure** (etcd issues, operator degraded, node not ready — common in two-node topologies):
  Use `ci:prow-job-analyze-resource` to trace K8s resource lifecycle via audit logs.
  Use `ci:prow-job-extract-must-gather` if must-gather archives are available.

For payload-level context: use `ci:fetch-new-prs-in-payload` to identify suspect PRs.
For JIRA context: use `ci:fetch-jira-issue` for any linked bugs, `ci:check-if-jira-regression-is-ongoing` for known regressions.

### Step 4: Write Analysis File

Collect the deep analysis results (from subagents or inline analysis) and write a small analysis-only JSON file keyed by `prow_url`. Use the actual report stem from Step 2 (e.g., `reports/analysis-2026-03-25.json` or `reports/analysis-2026-03-25-143027.json`):

```json
{
  "by_prow_url": {
    "https://prow.ci.openshift.org/view/gs/.../123": {
      "root_cause": "One-sentence explanation of the root cause",
      "failure_type": "Infrastructure flake | Test regression | Install failure | Platform issue",
      "impact": "How this affects payload acceptance and which topologies",
      "suspect_prs": ["https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"],
      "recommendation": "Specific next action (file bug, wait for fix, investigate PR, etc.)"
    }
  }
}
```

This file is intentionally small — it contains only the AI analysis results, not the full report data. This minimizes token usage.

### Step 5: Patch Analysis into HTML

Patch the analysis directly into the existing HTML report. Use the actual report path from Step 2:

```bash
cd payload-monitor && python -m payload_monitor \
  --merge-analysis reports/<actual-analysis>.json \
  --output reports/<actual-report>.html
```

This finds each job's detail section by its prow URL and injects the "AI Root Cause Analysis" card directly into the HTML. No JSON round-trip needed.

If there were no blocking failures (no analysis file), skip this step entirely — the HTML report is already complete.

### Step 6: Present Output

Do NOT duplicate the report data or findings summary — the HTML dashboard already contains all of that. Present only a brief confirmation:

```
## Edge Payload Monitor Report Generated

Report: `payload-monitor/reports/report-{date}.html`

Analyzed {N} blocking job failure(s) with AI root cause analysis.
Open the HTML report for the full interactive dashboard with findings summary, suggested actions, and detailed analysis.
```

Offer follow-up actions the user can take from this session:
- **Create JIRA bugs** for untracked failures
- **Set release blocker** on a JIRA issue (`ci:set-release-blocker`)
- **Triage a regression** in Component Readiness (`ci:triage-regression`)
- **Trigger payload job** to test a fix (`ci:trigger-payload-job`)
- **Investigate an informing job** further (`ci:prow-job-analyze-test-failure`)

## Important Notes

- The Python tool must be run from the `payload-monitor/` directory
- Dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (requests, jinja2, pyyaml, click)
- JIRA features require a `JIRA_TOKEN` environment variable (get a token from [JIRA API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens))
- Prow artifact fetching requires `gsutil` (Google Cloud SDK)
- Do NOT modify the Python source code — this skill is an orchestration layer on top
- Do NOT duplicate report data in your output — the HTML dashboard is the primary output, keep your response brief
- Deep analysis runs automatically for **blocking jobs only** — informing jobs get a Claude suggestion instead
- Prioritize blocking failures over informing failures in all analysis
- Flag recurring failures prominently — 2+ payload recurrence strongly suggests a real regression, not a flake
- For TNF/TNA failures, pay special attention to etcd, Pacemaker, and fencing-related errors
- For SNO failures, check for single-node-specific issues like workload partitioning, resource constraints
- When multiple edge topologies fail in the same payload, investigate whether it's a shared platform issue vs topology-specific

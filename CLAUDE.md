# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

Edge Tooling is a multi-tool deployment and development toolkit for OpenShift and edge computing environments. The repository provides automation for deploying OpenShift clusters in various configurations, managing cloud infrastructure, and setting up development workspaces.

## Tool Quick Reference

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Two-Node Toolbox | `two-node-toolbox/` | OpenShift two-node cluster deployment (arbiter/fencing topologies) |
| EC2 Deploy | `ec2-deploy/` | Standalone EC2 instance setup for development |
| SNO Deploy | `sno-deploy/` | Single Node OpenShift with DU configuration |
| LVM Operator Environment | `environments/lvm-operator/` | Development workspace template for LVMS |

## Getting Started - Use Case Guide

**Choose your tool based on your goal:**

- **Need a two-node HA OpenShift cluster?** → Use Two-Node Toolbox
- **Need a standalone EC2 development host?** → Use EC2 Deploy
- **Need a single-node OpenShift with DU config?** → Use SNO Deploy
- **Developing the LVM Operator?** → Use LVM Operator Environment

**Common workflow:** Deploy an EC2 instance with `ec2-deploy/`, then use `two-node-toolbox/` to deploy a cluster on that instance.

## Two-Node Toolbox (two-node-toolbox/)

A comprehensive deployment automation framework for OpenShift two-node clusters in development and testing environments.

### Purpose

Deploy and manage OpenShift clusters with high availability configurations:
- **Two-Node with Arbiter (TNA)**: Master nodes + separate arbiter node for quorum
- **Two-Node with Fencing (TNF)**: Master nodes with BMC-based fencing for HA

### Deployment Methods

| Method | Use Case | Playbook |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Dev-scripts | Traditional, full control | `setup.yml` |
| Kcli | Modern, faster setup | `kcli-install.yml` |

### Key Commands

```bash
# From two-node-toolbox/deploy/ directory:

# Deploy AWS hypervisor and cluster in one command
make deploy arbiter-ipi   # Deploy arbiter topology cluster
make deploy fencing-ipi   # Deploy fencing topology cluster

# Instance lifecycle management
make create              # Create new EC2 instance
make init                # Initialize deployed instance
make start               # Start stopped EC2 instance
make stop                # Stop running EC2 instance
make destroy             # Destroy EC2 instance and resources

# Cluster operations
make redeploy-cluster    # Redeploy OpenShift cluster
make shutdown-cluster    # Shutdown cluster VMs
make startup-cluster     # Start cluster VMs and proxy
make clean               # Clean OpenShift cluster
make full-clean          # Complete cleanup including cache

# Utilities
make ssh                 # SSH into EC2 instance
make info                # Display instance information
make inventory           # Update inventory.ini with current instance IP
```

### Ansible Playbooks

#### Dev-scripts Method
```bash
# Install required collections
ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections/requirements.yml

# Interactive deployment (prompts for topology)
ansible-playbook setup.yml -i inventory.ini

# Non-interactive deployment
ansible-playbook setup.yml -e "topology=arbiter" -e "interactive_mode=false" -i inventory.ini
ansible-playbook setup.yml -e "topology=fencing" -e "interactive_mode=false" -i inventory.ini

# Redfish stonith configuration (for fencing topology)
ansible-playbook redfish.yml -i inventory.ini

# Cleanup
ansible-playbook clean.yml -i inventory.ini
```

#### Kcli Method
```bash
# Deploy fencing cluster (default topology for kcli)
ansible-playbook kcli-install.yml -i inventory.ini

# Custom cluster configuration
ansible-playbook kcli-install.yml -i inventory.ini -e "test_cluster_name=my-cluster"

# Force cleanup and redeploy
ansible-playbook kcli-install.yml -i inventory.ini -e "force_cleanup=true"
```

### Purpose

Quickly provision a RHEL-based EC2 development host that can be used as a hypervisor for OpenShift cluster deployments.

### Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI configured** with `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable set
2. **Environment file**: Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and configure

Verify AWS CLI setup:
```bash
aws configure list
```

### Key Commands

```bash
# From ec2-deploy/ directory:

# Deploy an EC2 instance and initialize it
make deploy init

# After SSH connection, run the configure script:
./configure.sh
# This will:
#   - Set a password for pitadmin (cockpit access)
#   - Login to RHSM for dnf access

# Utility commands
make ssh       # SSH into the EC2 instance
make info      # Get instance info
make destroy   # Cleanup the deployment
```

## LVM Operator Environment (environments/lvm-operator/)

A development workspace template for LVMS (Logical Volume Manager Storage) operator development.

### Purpose

Provide a structured workspace for developing the LVM Operator across multiple related repositories.

### Workflow

1. Clone this workspace as your development root
2. Clone LVMS source repositories under `repos/`
3. Work from the top-level directory for full context across all repos
4. Navigate into `repos/<repo-name>/` for specific implementations

### Repository Structure

| Repository | Category | Purpose |
|------------|----------|---------|
| `lvm-operator` | Development | Core operator source, bundle, must-gather |
| `topolvm` | Development | Underlying CSI driver for LVM |
| `release` | Testing | Prow-based CI/CD configuration |
| `konflux-release-data` | Deployment | Konflux build/release orchestration |
| `product-definitions` | Deployment | Product Security gatekeeper |

### Key Paths in lvm-operator

- `.tekton/` - Konflux pipeline definitions
- `api/` - LVM operator API definitions
- `bundle/` - Auto-generated bundle manifests
- `cmd/` - Operator binary entrypoints
- `internal/` - Primary operator source code
- `test/` - Unit, integration, and E2E tests

### Fork Model

All repositories **except `konflux-release-data`** use a fork model:
- Push changes to your personal fork first
- Create pull requests from fork to upstream
- `konflux-release-data` uses branching: `<user_alias>/<changeset_summary>`

---

## Common Workflows

### EC2 → Two-Node Toolbox Deployment

1. Deploy EC2 instance: `cd ec2-deploy && make deploy init`
2. Configure instance: `./configure.sh`
3. Clone two-node-toolbox on instance or use Ansible from local machine
4. Deploy cluster: `cd two-node-toolbox/deploy && make deploy arbiter-ipi`

### SNO for Single-Node Testing

1. Ensure prerequisites in `~/.sno-deploy/`
2. Deploy: `make CLUSTER="test-cluster"`
3. Access: Use credentials from `~/.sno-deploy/test-cluster/creds/`

### LVM Operator Development

1. Clone workspace: `git clone <this-repo> lvm-workspace`
2. Clone repos: `cd lvm-workspace/environments/lvm-operator/repos && git clone <lvm-operator>`
3. Develop with full context from workspace root

## Maintaining This Documentation

### Automatic Submodule Update Detection

A Claude Code hook checks whether git submodules (e.g., `two-node-toolbox/`) are behind their remote tracking branch at session start. If a submodule is stale, Claude will report how many commits it is behind and offer to update it.

**Hook location:** `.claude/hooks/update-submodules.sh`

**Behavior:**
1. Silently initializes any uninitialized submodules
2. Fetches from each submodule's remote and compares the pinned commit to the remote branch tip
3. If any submodules are behind, Claude reports the details and asks if you'd like to update
4. If you accept, Claude runs `git submodule update --remote <path>`, stages the change, and commits

The hook resolves each submodule's tracking branch in order: `.gitmodules` branch config, `origin/HEAD`, `main`, `master`. It exits silently if offline or if no `.gitmodules` file exists.

### Automatic New Tool Detection

This repository includes a Claude Code hook that automatically detects new tool directories at session start. When a new tool directory is added (a directory with a Makefile or README.md), Claude will:

1. Detect the undocumented tool
2. Notify the user
3. Offer to update this CLAUDE.md file

**Hook location:** `.claude/hooks/detect-new-tools.sh`

**When adding a new tool**, update the `DOCUMENTED_TOOLS` array in the hook script:

```bash
DOCUMENTED_TOOLS=(
    "two-node-toolbox"
    "ec2-deploy"
    "sno-deploy"
    "environments/lvm-operator"
    "your-new-tool"  # Add new tools here
)
```

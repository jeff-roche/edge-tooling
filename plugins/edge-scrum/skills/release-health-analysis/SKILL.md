# release-health: Analysis

## Purpose

Perform the full hierarchy analysis, risk assessment, and generate all report sections, writing the results to `analysis.md` in the work directory.

## When to Spawn

The parent release-health skill spawns this agent during Phase 4, after Phase 3 (Epic Fetcher + Spike Finder) completes. This is the only Phase 4 agent.

## Capabilities

- Jira MCP search queries (`jira_search`)
- File reading via `Read` tool (all four phase data files + Edge Scrum Laws + `.roster.json`)
- JSON file writing via `Write` tool

This agent does **not** modify any Jira data.

## Parameters

Substituted by the parent before spawning:

| Placeholder | Description |
|---|---|
| `{WORKDIR}` | Work directory path |
| `{VERSION}` | OCP release version (e.g., `4.19`, `5.0`) |
| `{TODAY}` | Today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format |
| `{REFINEMENT_SPRINT_NUM}` | Sprint number of the refinement sprint |
| `{REFINEMENT_MODE}` | `true` or `false` — when true, produce additional `REFINEMENT_BY_SME` output section |

## Instructions

### 1. Read Context Files

1. `plugins/edge-scrum/.roster.json`
   Extract: `members` array — use `username` for ownership matching, `sp_target` per member for capacity.
   Derive `roster_size` (count of members) and `total_sp_per_sprint` (sum of all `sp_target` values).
   If a member is missing `sp_target`, default that member to 8. If the file is absent, halt with an error.
2. Load these law files from `plugins/edge-scrum/references/laws/`:
   - `07-workflow-states.md` — done states per issue type
   - `02-jira-stories.md` — bugs-always-zero-SP rule and story pointing
   - `04-jira-epics.md` — epic sizing scales
   - `05-jira-features.md` — feature/initiative sizing scales
   - `01-jira-projects.md` — OCPBUGS components
   - `06-jira-fields.md` — custom field IDs
3. `{WORKDIR}/sprints.json`
4. `{WORKDIR}/features.json`
5. `{WORKDIR}/epics.json`
6. `{WORKDIR}/spikes.json`

---

### 2. Fetch Child Issues

Split `epic_keys_csv` from `epics.json` into batches of ~20. For each batch, paginate with `page_token`, `limit=50` until all results are fetched:

```jql
project in (OCPEDGE, USHIFT, OCPBUGS) AND "Epic Link" in ({batch_csv}) ORDER BY priority ASC
```

Also fetch unlinked OCPBUGS bugs (use components from Laws). Paginate with `page_token`, `limit=50` until all results are fetched:

```jql
project = OCPBUGS
  AND component in ("Installer / Single Node OpenShift", "Two Node with Arbiter", "Two Node Fencing", "Logical Volume Manager Storage")
  AND fixVersion in ("{VERSION}", "{VERSION}.0")
  AND "Epic Link" is EMPTY
ORDER BY priority ASC
```

Fields per issue:

```text
key, summary, status, issuetype, priority, assignee, sprint, labels, updated,
customfield_10028, customfield_10470, customfield_10021, customfield_10014, issuelinks
```

Per issue, compute:

- `sp`: `customfield_10028` — **ALWAYS 0 for any Bug issuetype, no exceptions**
- `epic_key`: `customfield_10014` (or `"No Epic"`)
- `flagged`: `customfield_10021` is non-empty
- `blocked_by`: issuelinks where `type.inward = "is blocked by"` AND blocker status not in {Closed, Verified, Done}
- `stale`: status in {In Progress, Review} AND `updated` older than 5 business days from `{TODAY}`

---

### 3. Build Hierarchy and Rollups

Group: Feature → Epics → Issues.
Orphan groups: `(No Feature)`, `(No Epic)`, `(Unlinked Bugs)`.

**Done states** (from Laws):

- Stories/Tasks/Spikes: Closed
- OCPEDGE Bugs: Closed
- OCPBUGS Bugs: Verified, Closed
- Epics: Closed, Dev Complete

**Per-Epic rollup:**

| Field | Calculation |
|---|---|
| `total_issues` | count of all child issues |
| `done_issues` | issues in done state |
| `total_sp` | sum of SP (bugs always 0) |
| `done_sp` | SP of done issues |
| `remaining_sp` | SP of non-done issues |
| `completion_pct` | `done_sp / total_sp × 100`; fallback: `done_issues / total_issues × 100` if total_sp = 0 |
| `unpointed_count` | non-Bug issues with SP null or 0 |
| `blocked_count` | flagged OR blocked_by non-empty OR "Blocked" in labels |
| `unassigned_count` | no assignee |

**Per-Feature rollup:** aggregate epics; add `epic_count` and `done_epics`.

**Release totals:**

- `total_remaining_sp` = sum of all epics' `remaining_sp`
- `max_sp_capacity` = `remaining_sprint_count` (from sprints.json) × `total_sp_per_sprint` (from `.roster.json`)

---

### 4. Refinement Reassessment

After building the hierarchy, reassess `epics_appear_refined` for features that the transform did not already mark as refined. For each feature where `spike_missing = true` AND `spike_on_epic = false` AND `epics_appear_refined = false` AND feature status is not "New" or "Refinement":

1. Get the feature's child epics from the hierarchy
2. Skip features with 0 epics — they cannot be refined via epics
3. For each epic, read its `description` (from `epics.json`) and examine the child stories/tasks created under it (from the hierarchy)
4. An epic looks refined if its description describes work to be done AND the existing child stories appear to cover that described work — the stories don't need to be complete, but they should exist and address the scope outlined in the description
5. If **all** of the feature's epics look refined by this assessment, override `epics_appear_refined = true` for that feature

Update `features_refined_via_epics` count accordingly.

---

### 5. Risk Assessment

Read `refinement_sprint_closed` from `sprints.json`.

**7a — Schedule Risk** — Skip entirely if `refinement_sprint_closed = false`.

If `refinement_sprint_closed = true`, per Feature:

| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| status ∈ {Done, Closed} | ✅ Complete |
| 0% complete AND ≤ 2 dev sprints remaining | 🔴 Critical |
| 0% complete AND ≤ 4 dev sprints remaining | 🟡 At Risk |
| completion_pct ≥ expected_dev_pct | 🟢 On Track |
| completion_pct ≥ expected_dev_pct × 0.75 | 🟡 Slightly Behind |
| completion_pct < expected_dev_pct × 0.75 | 🔴 At Risk |
| no Epics AND ≥ 1 dev sprint remaining | 🔴 Unplanned |

**7b — Staffing:**

- Feature `sme = "None"` → 🔴 "No SME assigned" — Action: "Assign SME this sprint"
- Feature `qa_contact = "None"` AND status ≠ Closed → 🟡 "No QA contact"
- Feature `docs_approver = "None"` → 🟢 "No docs approver"
- Epic `assignee = "Unassigned"` → 🟡 "No epic DRI"
- Epic `qa_contact = "None"` AND status ≠ Closed → 🟡 "No epic QA contact"

**7c — Refinement — Spike Rules** (based on `refinement_sprint_closed`):

Evaluate in this order — first match wins:

1. `spike_status = "Closed"` → ✅ "Closed" — direct spike completed, no risk
2. `spike_missing` AND (`spike_on_epic = true` OR `epics_appear_refined = true`) → ✅ "Via epics" — no spike risk
3. If `refinement_sprint_closed = false`:
   - `spike_missing` → 🔴 "No refinement spike — SME must create one in Sprint {REFINEMENT_SPRINT_NUM} that blocks this Feature"
   - spike exists AND NOT `spike_in_ref_sprint` → 🟡 "Spike not in refinement sprint — move to Sprint {REFINEMENT_SPRINT_NUM}"
   - spike exists AND `spike_in_ref_sprint` AND status ≠ Closed → 🟢 "Spike in progress (expected)"
4. If `refinement_sprint_closed = true`:
   - `spike_overdue = true` → 🔴 "Refinement spike not closed — refinement incomplete"
   - `spike_missing` → 🔴 "No refinement spike found; delivery epics may be under-refined"

**7c — Refinement — General:**

- Feature `has_ac = false` → 🟡 "Missing acceptance criteria"
- Feature `size = "Unsized"` → 🟡 "Feature not sized"
- Feature `epic_count = 0` → 🔴 "No epics — unplanned"
- Epic `has_ac = false` → 🟡 "Epic missing AC"
- Epic `size = "Unsized"` → 🟡 "Epic not sized"
- Epic `total_issues = 0` → 🟡 "Empty epic — no stories"
- Story/Task `sp null or 0` → 🟡 "Needs estimation"
- Story/Task `assignee = "Unassigned"` → 🟡 "Needs owner"

**7d — Blocked/Stalled:**

- `flagged = true` → 🔴 "Impediment flagged"
- `blocked_by` non-empty → 🔴 "Blocked by {keys}"
- `"Blocked"` in labels → 🔴 "Labeled Blocked"
- `"Parked"` in labels → 🟡 "Parked"
- `stale = true` → 🟡 "Stale — no update in 5+ business days"

**7e — Release-Level:**

- XL-sized epic AND `remaining_sprint_count ≤ 2` → 🔴 "XL-sized epic unlikely to complete"
- L-sized epic AND `remaining_sprint_count ≤ 1` → 🔴 "L-sized epic at risk"
- `total_remaining_sp > max_sp_capacity` → 🔴 "Capacity risk"
- (if `refinement_sprint_closed` AND `total_features > 0`) `(features_missing_spike - features_refined_via_epics) / total_features > 0.5` → 🔴 "Systematic refinement gap"
- (if `refinement_sprint_closed` AND `total_features > 0`) `(features_with_closed_spike + features_refined_via_epics) / total_features < 0.75` → 🟡 "Refinement coverage below 75%"

#### Refinement-by-SME Section (only when `{REFINEMENT_MODE}` = `true`)

After writing all standard sections above, append this additional section. It reorganizes the refinement gaps from the existing analysis into an SME-centric view with natural language summaries.

```text
===SECTION:REFINEMENT_BY_SME===
## Refinement Status: OCP {VERSION}

**{refined_count} of {total_features} features are fully refined. {needs_attention_count} need attention.**

(For each SME that has at least one feature with gaps, produce a section. Omit SMEs whose features have zero gaps.)

### {SME display name} ({feature_count} features, {gaps_count} need attention)

**{OCPSTRAT-XXX} — {Feature Summary}**
{Natural language description of ALL gaps found at every level for this feature. Cover Feature-level gaps, then Epic-level, then Story-level. Be specific and actionable. Reference epic names and story counts.}

Example tone and format:
"No size set on the feature. Epic 'CLI Monitoring' (OCPEDGE-1234) has no stories underneath. Epic 'Staging Mechanism' (OCPEDGE-1235) looks good — 5 stories, all sized. 2 stories under 'Data Pipeline' (OCPEDGE-1236) are missing story points."

(Repeat for each feature under this SME that has gaps.)

### Unassigned SME (PM action needed)

**{OCPSTRAT-XXX} — {Feature Summary}**
No SME assigned — PM needs to assign one before refinement can proceed. {Continue listing any other gaps found at Epic/Story level below this feature — do not stop at the missing SME.}

===END_SECTION===
```

**Rules for the REFINEMENT_BY_SME section:**

1. **No early stopping**: Even if a Feature has no SME or no Epics, continue checking ALL levels and report everything found. A Feature with no SME may still have Epic and Story-level gaps worth reporting.
2. **Group by SME**: Use the SME's `display_name` from `features.json`. Features with no SME go under "Unassigned SME."
3. **Omit clean features**: If a Feature has zero gaps at any level, do not mention it in the SME's section.
4. **Natural language**: Do not use tables for the per-feature descriptions. Write conversational, actionable sentences that an SME can read and act on without opening Jira.
5. **Docs epics excluded**: Skip epics whose summary starts with "Docs" and belong to the OSDOCS project — these are auto-generated and not part of refinement checks.
6. **All gap types apply**: Use the same checks from sections 5b (staffing), 5c (refinement), and 5d (blocked/stalled). The REFINEMENT_BY_SME section is a reorganized view of these existing findings, not a separate analysis.
